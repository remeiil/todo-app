# React + Vite
  
This todo app was made by following a React.js tutorial by James Macarthur/Smoljames/jamezmca.  
  
## My added touches  
- I have added my own CSS and layout.  
- I have added an edit function and category tracking

## Future additions and notes
- At this stage I plan to continue to use localstorage but may add auth and server side storage later.  
- I will be adding daily/recurring tasks based on the day of the week (check local time and display tasks that have the same day of the week) I also want these to auto reset but I can only think of a manual button that would be pressed once a week so will have to think on it some more before implementing.  
- I will also add instructions for deploying the app  both for my own and other's reference once I'm happy with the app.
